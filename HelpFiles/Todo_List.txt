Step 9 - Create a new storyBrain object from the StoryBrain class.
Step 10 - use the storyBrain to get the first story title and display it in this Text Widget.
Step 11 - Create a method called getChoice1() that returns the text for the first choice1 from _storyData.
Step 12 - Create a method called getChoice2() that returns the text for the first choice2 from _storyData.
Step 13 - Use the storyBrain to get the text for choice 1.
Step 14 - Use the storyBrain to get the text for choice 2.
Step 15 - Run the app and see if you can see the screen update with the first story.
Step 16 - Create a property called storyNumber which starts with a value of 0. This will be used to track which story the user is currently viewing.
Step 17 - Create a method called nextStory(), it should not have any outputs but it should have 1 input called choiceNumber which will be the choice number (int) made by the user.
Step 18 - Call the nextStory() method from storyBrain and pass the number 1 as the choice made by the user.
Step 19 - Call the nextStory() method from storyBrain and pass the number 2 as the choice made by the user.

Step 21 - Using the story plan, update nextStory() to change the storyNumber depending on the choice made by the user. e.g. if choiceNumber was equal to 1 and the storyNumber is 0, the storyNumber should become 2.
Step 22 - In nextStory() if the storyNumber is equal to 3 or 4 or 5, that means it's the end of the game and it should call a method called restart() that resets the storyNumber to 0.
Step 23 - Use the storyNumber property inside getStory(), getChoice1() and getChoice2() so that it gets the updated story and choices rather than always just the first (0th) one.
